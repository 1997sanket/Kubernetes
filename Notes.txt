1. In order to make an external service, just put type as "LoadBalancer" in the spec tag of yaml file.

2. ClusterIP is default which is same as Internal Service.

3. LoadBalancer gives internal as well as external IP address.

4. We can define an external service inorder to call it from a web-browser. But it will have IP address which is not we want 
	in our application. We want a domain name like google.com 
   - In order to do that we use Ingress Component.
   - Ingress component needs an implementation called Ingress Controller (K8S implementation is Nginx ingress controller).
   - So "http://myapp.com" request comes to our Ingress Controller which reads our Ingress yaml file and redirect the request
		to a particular service(this needs to be an internal service).
   - Also, Ingress gives us an IP address which we need to map to the domain name.(which is typically done using a Load Balancer
		service in a Cloud provider.
   - Inorder to make application secure using "https", we need to add "tls" configuration in our ingress yaml file, with 
	SSL certificate key and value kept in the Secret service.
